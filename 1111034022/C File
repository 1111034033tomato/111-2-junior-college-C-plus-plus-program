// "FILE" is basically a data type, and we need to create a pointer variable to work with it "(fptr)" . 
//For now, this line is not important. It's just something you need when working with files.
//To actually open a file, use the fopen() function, which takes two parameters:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fptr;

  // Create a file on your computer (filename.txt)
  fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "w");

  // Close the file
  fclose(fptr);

  return 0;
}
