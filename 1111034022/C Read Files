//In the previous chapter, we wrote to a file using w and a modes inside the fopen() function.
//To read from a file, you can use the r mode:

FILE *fptr;

// Open a file in read mode
fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "r");

//Next, we need to create a string that should be big enough to store the content of the file.
//For example, let's create a string that can store up to 100 characters:

FILE *fptr;

// Open a file in read mode
fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "r");

// Store the content of the file
char myString[100];
