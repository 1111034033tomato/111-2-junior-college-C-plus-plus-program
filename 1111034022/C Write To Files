//Use the w mode from the previous chapter again, and write something to the file we just created.
//The w mode means that the file is opened for writing. 
//To insert content to it, you can use the fprint() function and add the pointer variable (fptr in our example) and some text:




#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fptr;

  // Open a file in writing mode
  fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "w");

  // Write some text to the file
  fprintf(fptr, "Some text");

  // Close the file
  fclose(fptr);

  return 0;
}
